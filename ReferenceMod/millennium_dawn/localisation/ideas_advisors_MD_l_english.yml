 advisor_GER_angela_merkel_desc:0 "Dr. Angela Dorothea Merkel has held public office since 1990, after having grown up in East Germany and achieving a scientific degree in physics.  She first assumed a major federal office for the Christian Democratic CDU when Helmut Kohl named her Federal Minister for Women and Youth in 1991 - after the German reunification - and later Federal Minister for Environment, Protection of Nature and Reactor Security in 1994. In 1998 she became secretary-general of the CDU and became the chairwoman in April of 2000, which made her leader of the opposition against the Schröder administration. Angela Merkel would be elected the 8th Federal Chancellor - and the first woman to hold that position - of Germany in 2005 and defend that position in 2009 and 2013. Merkel is noted as a believer in realpolitik approaches to national and international issues, conflicts and disputes. She rarely engages in open hostility towards any particular faction, for example warning against an overly anti-British stance after the Brexit referendum of June 2016."

He however is most famous - and infamous - for his role as Federal Minister of Finance from 2009 onwards, where he gained notoriety through his hardline stance on economically struggling EU member states like Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece.

 advisor_GER_ursula_von_der_leyen:0 "Ursula von der Leyen"
 advisor_GER_ursula_von_der_leyen_desc:0 "Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen has been active in politics since 1999, first entering state-level politics in 2003 and federal politics in 2005, when she was appointed Federal Minister of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth during Angela Merkel's first term. Subsequently, Merkel's second term saw her shift positions to serve as Minister of Labor and Social Affairs from 2009 to 2013 before finally switching positions again to become Germany's first female Minister of Defense under Merkel's third term in office. Her stance on the Ukraine conflict is notably moderate, advocating Ukrainian-Russian negotiations and arguing against arms exports to Ukraine because of the unlimited weapons supply at Russia's disposal that could be put to use in case of an arms race. On the other hand, Von der Leyen has been an outspoken advocate of German militarization and increase of military funding in face of enormous logistical problems surrounding the German Bundeswehr."
 advisor_GER_thomas_de_maiziere:0 "Thomas de Maizière"
 advisor_GER_thomas_de_maiziere_desc:0 "A noted hardliner within the conservative CDU, Karl Ernst Thomas de Maizière has served as Minister of the Interior from 2009 to 2011 and then again from 2011 onwards, interrupted by a short term as Minister of Defense. De Maizière has been faced with numerous problems, including a large-scale refugee crisis and a logistical disaster within the Bundeswehr. Especially during the refugee crisis, De Maizière has been noted as significantly more cautious of possible downsides of a large intake of refugees, as opposed to the general optimism by the rest of the Merkel government. De Maizière has fought back on islamic terrorism, left-wing extremist newspapers, right-wing extremist terror groups and has always been an outspoken supporter of conservative ideals - making him a controversial figure in the Merkel administration."
 advisor_GER_alexander_dobrindt:0 "Alexander Dobrindt"
 advisor_GER_alexander_dobrindt_desc:0 "Bavarian CSU member Alexander Dobrindt is a loyal follower of party kingpin Horst Seehofer, serving as Secretary-General under Seehofer's chairmanship from 2009 to 2013. Since 2013, Dobrindt serves in federal politics as Federal Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. His most notable project is the so-called 'PkW-Maut', a road toll on Germany's autobahn system which is famous for its lack of a general speed limit, making it a path of transportation of choice for both Germans and foreigners alike. Dobrindt's road toll was aimed at all drivers, but Germans would be refunded through a cut to their car tax - causing concern in other countries that this might be a breach of European Union codes of law."
 advisor_GER_horst_seehofer:0 "Horst Seehofer"
 advisor_GER_horst_seehofer_desc:0 "Horst Lorenz Seehofer has been a leading voice in the conservative faction of CDU and CSU, being one of the main politicians of the Bavarian (and quite more conservative) CSU. Seehofer has served as Federal Minister of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Head of the Bundesrat and Federal Minister of Health, having been a Bundestag member from 1980 to 2008. Since 2008, he has gone back to primarily focussing on Bavarian state-level politics, serving as CSU chairman and as Minister President of Bavaria, Germany's largest and second-most populous state. Seehofer's hyper-conservative stance, especially on the refugee crisis, has caused friction with Merkel's more moderate CDU before, but a breakdown of the pact between the two parties seems highly unlikely."
 advisor_GER_gerd_mueller:0 "Gerd Müller"
 advisor_GER_gerd_mueller_desc:0 "Gerhard Müller, not to be confused with the famous football player by the same name, is a CSU politician and has served as Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development from 2013 onwards.

 advisor_GER_sigmar_gabriel:0 "Sigmar Gabriel"

Within his own party, he is controversial due to his very moderate position, making him a right-winger within the Social Democrats.

 advisor_GER_frank_walter_steinmeier_desc:0 "Frank-Walter Steinmeier is a giant within the SPD and an established expert of Foreign Policy, having served as Foreign Minister under both the first and the third Merkel administration, when his SPD allied with the CDU. He had been Vice Chancellor of Germany from 2007 to 2009, before he went on to challenge Merkel in 2009 - a bid which ended up in a crushing defeat and a coalition between the conservative CDU and the market liberal FDP, pushing Steinmeier's SPD into the opposition and making Steinmeier opposition leader. In 2013, after the FDP failed to re-qualify for the Federal Assembly, the CDU and the SPD renewed their alliance and Steinmeier became one of Germany's leading ministers once more. In 2017, when Joachim Gauck resigned as Head of State, Steinmeier ended up being endorsed by both Sigmar Gabriel and, after a short delay, Angela Merkel, and subsequently was elected Federal President, Head of State of the German republic."

Born in 1941, Gauland was an experienced lawyer and journalist before entering politics in 2010 when Angela Merkel flip-flopped on a public promise to not financially aid the Greek government. Gauland became one of the three leading co-founders of the Election Alternative 2013, which ended up becoming the AfD. Whereas the other two, Konrad Adam and Bernd Lucke, were closer to the neo-liberal spectrum, Alexander Gauland was the leader of a national conservative school of thought within the AfD and would eventually find an ally in Frauke Petry. The two ended up eliminating Bernd Lucke in an internal power struggle, with Petry taking party leadership and Gauland becoming federal spokesman. Gauland's and Petry's faction ended up securing lots of popular support, with the AfD scoring as high as 24% of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt. In Gauland's home state Brandenburg, the result was still a considerable 12.2%. Gauland continues to guide AfD policy from behind the scenes, notably protecting controversial orator Björn Höcke from many inner-party consequences for Höcke's pro-nazi speeches."
